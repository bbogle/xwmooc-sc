title: Workshop Checklist &mdash; Lead Instructor
---
<p>
  Along with the
  <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/checklists/instructors.html">usual duties of an instructor</a>,
  lead instructors are responsible
  for leading discussions among the instructors and host about what to teach
  and who's teaching what.
  They are also responsible for making sure that
  the workshop's web page and repository are set up in good time,
  and for handling evaluation.
</p>

<p>
  All of these duties can be delegated,
  but it's the lead instructor's responsibility to make sure they are done.
  If you've been assigned the lead instructor role
  but aren't comfortable with it,
  or find that you don't have time,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">let Software Carpentry admin know</a>
  as soon as possible.
</p>

  <h4>Initial Preparation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create the
      <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">GitHub repository</a>
      that will host the workshop's web pages.
      <a href="https://vimeo.com/87241285">This video</a> shows how to do it as of early 2014.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Send the workshop's URL to the administrators</strong>
      so that they can add it to the main web site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Talk to the workshop host about the workshop audience
      and their desired curriculum and level.
      Talk to the workshop host about the audience;
      what field(s) are they from,
      and what is their expertise level,
      and what curriculum would interest them?
    </li>
    <li>
      With the other instructors, decide:
      <ul>
        <li>what content to cover,</li>
        <li>what the schedule will be, and</li>
        <li>who will teach what.</li>
      </ul>
      This usually takes a few iterations, so don't leave it until the last minute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a schedule for your workshop
      with instructors' names against each topic being taught.
      Be sure to allow enough
      time to set up
      on the first day,
      and for learners to fill in the <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/assess/index.html">post-workshop assessment</a> on the last day.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create the home page for the workshop in that repository,
      and either write or recycle a description of the curriculum
      and setup instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create an Etherpad for the workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're local to the workshop site,
      suggest some helpers if you can.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consult with the host on whether any learners, instructors, or helpers have identified
      accessibility needs that need advance preparation
      (see the <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/checklists/accessibility.html">accessibility checklist</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Consult the
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/checklists/instructors.html">instructors' checklist</a>:
      all of those tasks apply to the lead instructor too.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>Several Weeks Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Send email to potential learners saying that registration is now open.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>A Week Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Send a reminder email to attendees about installing software,</strong>
      and offer to help people who are having problems.
      A <a href="#email">template email message</a> is included in this checklist.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure the <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/assess/index.html">pre-workshop assessment questionnaire</a> has been created
      and sent to your learners,
      and share the responses with your fellow instructors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure all the instructors have posted their materials
      on the workshop web site.
    </li>
    <li>
      If possible, introduce yourself to the helpers;
      give them the link to the workshop webpage
      and ask them to follow the setup instructions;
      and ask them to arrive at least 15 minutes earlier than learners.
    </li>
    <li>
      Check the link to the Windows installer in your setup instructions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>First-Day Welcome</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Remind everyone of the <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure all learners are set up correctly and have sticky notes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remind learners of the workshop's goals and schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remind helpers to mingle and encourage conversation
      as well as answer questions and debug setup problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      As learners arrive,
      ask them to connect to the network
      and check that they have software installed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Circulate the sign-in sheet and photo release form.
    </li>
    <li>
      Distribute colored sticky notes to learners.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>During the Workshop</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before each break,
      have learners
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#feedback">submit feedback</a>
      on their sticky notes.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>At the End</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask for feedback (one good thing and one bad thing)
      and send it to Software Carpentry.
      You can collect it on sticky notes,
      on the Etherpad,
      or in a plain text file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Distribute the <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/assess/index.html">post-workshop assessment</a>.
      It's best if learners complete it before they leave.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss why assessment is important for Software Carpentry and for participants
      (quantitatively show and measure impact,
      better funding,
      ways workshops can improve for the future).
    </li>
    <li>
      Let participants know
      they will be asked to volunteer
      for impact study interview in 3 months.
      Very few people have been volunteering
      so their participation is very important.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>After</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Debrief with Greg.

    <li>
      Fill in the
